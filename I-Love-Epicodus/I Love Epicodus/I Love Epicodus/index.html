    <h1> Thank you Epicodus</h1>
    <h2> I love the concept of a Growth Mindset.</h2>
    <p>As an educator, the growth mindset is a notion I have believed in for a long time. I have encouraged my students to  "believe" they can learn anything and approach new ideas with a sense of "play." Generally, they will be rewarded with progress in their skills and develop a love of learning in the process.</p>
    <p>My own approach to life and learning is the same. If I was disappointed with something I had tried, my father would say:"Well, did you learn anything?" My answer was always,"yes." For my dad, life itself was learning. As a navigator in the Air Force, he was the onboard "computer." Armed with his slide rule and primative instument readings he would get the flight crew from the take off to landing at the desired destination across seas and above clouds and sometimes through lightning storms or flack from the battlefield. He computed the flight path taking into consideration the constantly changing variables of wind speed and direction, fuel consumption that affected the weight of the aircraft and its speed. He retired when I was a teenager. He was always reading and often read reference materials for entertainment. Once he was reading the dictionary out loud  at the kitchen table. He started laughing uproariously and said,"Do you know what the definition of boring is?" I replied, "Having my dad read me definitions out of the dictionary?" He took his glasses off, and got very quiet. I saw that his feelings were hurt and  gave him a big hug and apologized for making fun of him. I asked, "Ok, what is it?" "He quietly replied, "Making a little hole." I sighed..."That's dumb, Dad."</p>
    <p>You can imagine that my family was quite nerdy even before nerd was even a word. I wasn't going to impress anyone, ever.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the Introductory classes at Epicodus, I am hooked on learning these concepts. I will keep "boring" away on learning to code until I drop. Thank you to everyone at Epicodus for making this new journey possible for me. This is in all respects my literal "Boring Lecture."
